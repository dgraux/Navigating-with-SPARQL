Navigating with SPARQL
======================

> A list of SPARQL ready-to-be-pasted binding blocks to compute
  operations on (lat,lon) pairs

Abstract
--------

Let's assume you are on a boat and have to navigate only basic items
such as a map or a compass, and a . . . . . . SPARQL engine! How to
set a course? How to compute distances? Here, we provide a set of
SPARQL code-blocks to be used in such situation and more generally in
use-cases where practitioners need to compute mathematical calculus on
geo-data represented by (lat,lon) pairs.
